# ðŸ’» Practical: R markdown

This file contains two functions in R that will calculate the days until my PU5058 report is due:

1.  The first function will get and return the current data from the local system.

2.  The second function will calculate the difference, in days, between today's date and the due date of the PU5058 report.

## Function 1: Get the Current Date



## Function 2: Days until PU5058 Report Due
